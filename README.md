# CSaP-Project-19/20 - Nicola Bottura 

A "whiteboard" application, where a community of users could interact and exchange messages.
A server will wait for connections, on a INET socket, forking new processes to handle interactions with clients(one process per client).

# How to use
To compile the program just execute the following command:
``` 
./compile.sh 
```
which will execute a ```make clean``` and a  ```make -f ./makefile```
